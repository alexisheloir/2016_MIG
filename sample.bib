	title = {Borg's perceived exertion and pain scales.},
	isbn = {0-88011-623-4 (Paperback)},
	abstract = {This book contains information about methods for measuring subjective somatic symptoms. The main focus is on the presentation of 2 scaling methods: the Borg RPE scale and the Borg CR10 scale. The Borg RPE scale is a scale for ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). It is a tool for estimating effort and exertion, breathlessness, and fatigue during physical work. The Borg CR10 scale is a category-ratio (CR) scale anchored at the number 10, which represents extreme intensities. It is a general intensity scale for most subjective magnitudes that with special anchors can be used to measure exertion and pain. A basic foundation for this book is the acceptance of a human as a psychosomatic whole. This means that psychological factors, such as personality, psychosocial factors, fear, and anxiety, affect somatic responses. It also means, however, that somatic functioning and signs of diseases can be studied psychologically, using human perception as a diagnostic instrument. This book deals primarily with the latter aspect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},
