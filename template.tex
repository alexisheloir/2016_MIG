\caption{This paper analyses the effect of posture variability of upper body on muscular fatigue and the casually called ''Gorilla arm´´ effect. Motion capture-based biomechanical simulation was used to understand differences in joint loads, muscle forces and activations. This figure shows the two conditions which we studied: in static posture the load is all the time concentrated on the same muscles and they quickly get fatigued, in variable posture the loaded muscles change over time which gives more time for them to recover.}

\begin{abstract}


Only time will tell if motion-controlled systems are the future of gaming and other industries and if mid-air gestureal input will eventually offering a more intuitive way to play games, learn certain skills and more.

If mid-air gestural input is promised to become a widespread input modality, it is necessary to assess its ergonomics and propose design guidelines which will guarantee a safe usage of mid-air gestures in the long run. This paper presents how muscular fatigue and the resulting ``Gorilla arm'' effect during mid-air interaction can be mitigated by introducing additional variability of the whole upper body posture. This paper also introduces an indirect pervasive strategy leveraging head-tracking and parallax effect encouraging postural changes during the interaction. A user study involving 30 subjects validates the setup through quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis. A quantitative analysis was conducted on data obtained using an optical motion capture setup together with biomechanical simulation. A qualitative analysis was conducted through Questionnaires. Both questionnaires and musculoskeletal loads data support our hypothesis and shows a statistically significant 15-25\% decrease in average muscle loads on the anterior and medial deltoids and biceps long  in the modified condition comparing to the baseline.
